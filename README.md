# DSA Practice 🧠

My personal space to track my comprehensive DSA practice.  
It is organized for long-term growth, easy revision, and interview preparation.

## Folder Structure:

- **`problems/`**: The main stash of problems. Organized by platform (LeetCode, CSES , etc.) and eventually the topic.
- **`lists/`**: Curated problem lists and checklists (Blind 75, Blind 150, random problems). Each problem in the problemset is referenced to any/all of these,
- **`notes/`**: Central repository of patterns, mistakes, and revision notes.
- **`daily-log.md`**: Tracks daily progress, patterns applied, and lessons learned.

## Problem Folder Template

Each problem is stored as:

`problems/<platform>/<topic>/<problem-id>-<problem-name>/`

Contents:

- `solution.<lang>` → Solution code
- `notes.md` → Problem-level notes, insights, mistakes, and key observations

---
## Workflow & Maintenance

1. Solve problems from curated lists or randomly.
2. Store the solution and notes in the designated folder.
3. Update the relevant list(s) to track completion.
4. Maintain `daily-log.md` for progress, patterns, and mistakes.
5. Commit frequently with concise, descriptive messages.

## Notes & Patterns

- Notes are concise, focusing on **key insights, patterns, and mistakes**.
- Patterns are documented in `notes/patterns.md` for easy revision.
- Mistakes and common pitfalls are tracked in `notes/mistakes.md`.
- Daily progress and reflections are recorded in `daily-log.md`.

---

## Conventions

- Folder and file naming is consistent for clarity:
  - `<problem-id>-<problem-name>` for folders
  - `solution.<lang>` for code
- Problems appear only once in `problems/` even if they are part of multiple lists.
- Empty folders contain `.gitkeep` or a placeholder file to preserve structure.
